WORD FOR WORDTRANSCRIPT:
[0.00 → 6.40]  2.3 minor hero knight cycle. There are so many different synergies and that's exactly why I love
[6.40 → 9.68]  this dick. We're actually going to be playing ranked with it today because I'm kind of confident
[9.68 → 14.16]  and the exact synergies I'm talking about is the hero knight will make everything they use
[14.16 → 19.60]  to target the minor go towards the knight and it's really cheap and then also because you play
[19.60 → 23.04]  minor on the tower they might play a swarm card you've got goblin curses up to instantly turn
[23.04 → 27.20]  them all against each other so the minor gets a ton of chip damage with the hero knight and the
[27.20 → 31.28]  goblin curse works really well with the minor and also on defense and whatnot and fun to troll
[31.28 → 34.64]  like even if he plays those skeletons next to the tower to defend the minor I'm gonna get
[34.64 → 38.56]  so much damage and it's gonna be so good so that's what I'm thinking for today's video
[38.56 → 42.64]  I'm gonna try and win a game on ranked or at least multiple games on ranked I'm feeling confident
[42.64 → 48.16]  you know why because today is my birthday I'm officially 25 uncle status has been reached and
[48.16 → 53.36]  this is a perfect situation you know what I'm against expo make everything lock onto the hero knight
[53.36 → 56.56]  you know what let's go for a zap to get a couple goblins force out some elixir
[57.20 → 61.92]  and uh there we go we made him overspend so if we can outplay this guy despite him playing 2.9
[61.92 → 66.56]  expo that's gonna be really good and Kenny when he has been going through kind of the roller coaster
[66.56 → 71.60]  of I don't know revelations you if you watch my videos you know Kenny when he's always talking
[71.60 → 76.32]  about things about life and sometimes people can resonate sometimes people cannot with what I'm
[76.32 → 82.32]  saying but I have I have so many realizations about things in the last like especially year
[82.32 → 87.68]  two years you know what pretty much since I started this channel honestly and I mean
[87.68 → 91.12]  maybe I'll make a minecraft video talking about it or something I don't know but for now
[91.68 → 95.36]  let's do it let's go for the goblin curse of rage instantly with the zap and look how much
[95.36 → 99.12]  damage we're gonna get right there bait out in the spirit as well and I think he's gonna feel
[99.12 → 102.64]  kind of desperate to go for it with an expo because of that so let's go for a dark goblin try and
[102.64 → 109.68]  predict it and he doesn't okay so let's just go for a cannon here because we need to get something
[109.68 → 114.80]  for those evo arches so let's go for a hero knight hero knights kind of op against the expo as well
[114.80 → 120.80]  because obviously it can make the expo retarget with its ability let's go for an evo zap and
[120.80 → 124.56]  that's gonna be a huge cop out here go for an evo zap that's just gonna take the whole thing out
[124.56 → 128.64]  and the good thing is our cycle is so quick that we can get to our evo so quickly we have a hero
[128.64 → 134.32]  as well I are kind of in a state of delirium bought the hero knight last night I'm not gonna lie
[134.32 → 139.36]  and I realized wait why didn't I do that earlier it's literally my career so anyway
[139.36 → 144.48]  that was that's what happened he's definitely gonna log this I'm gonna cycle an ice spirit
[144.48 → 148.08]  and then you know what let's just go like this and this just to make sure we can take out that
[148.08 → 152.16]  tesla and we get that let's go for a goblin curse as well just to do some damage and clear any
[152.16 → 155.84]  potential swarm card and then let's go for another knight and that's gonna be able to take out the
[155.84 → 161.20]  whole expo very nice let's go for a dark goblin as well try and take this out go for a zap to
[161.20 → 165.04]  cycle we don't really need the ability it would be a waste of elixir there and then let's just
[165.04 → 170.32]  let that go Kenny's feeling good can just go for skelies here and we cycled our zap again so we're
[170.32 → 175.12]  getting close to that evo zap and if he plays okay let's go like this he's probably gonna protect
[175.12 → 180.00]  the expo but it doesn't really matter too much then let's go for this let's go for a curse as well
[180.00 → 186.08]  to make those skeletons a threat and then let's go for a zap okay I'm lagging let's go for an ability
[186.08 → 190.16]  please I think if I wasn't lagging I might have been able to get it off there but it's all good
[190.16 → 194.80]  because hopefully dark goblin clean up nice okay we're still winning we're still winning
[195.44 → 199.84]  oh my god dark goblin please get a hit okay nice let's go for this in the back let's go for hero
[199.84 → 204.48]  knight in the other lane and then let's go for a goblin curse and then we can go for a dart outside
[204.48 → 209.04]  of the teslas range try and snipe this and then I can just evo zap the tower and the expo and that's
[209.04 → 214.80]  gonna be a lot of damage very cool we could beat this we can beat this guy he's probably gonna spam
[214.80 → 219.20]  another expo because the teslas there let's go for a minor hopefully the knight doesn't catch it
[219.84 → 225.60]  but it does okay that tesla seems to have infinite health let's go for a knight right now I'm not
[225.60 → 230.00]  gonna choke this game I refuse to let's go for a dark goblin in the middle so he doesn't get fireball
[230.00 → 234.32]  value oh he missed the fireball let's go for hero knight ability and then let's go for a goblin curse
[234.32 → 238.48]  and a zap and hopefully he plays skeletons in there and we're gonna be able to take out the
[238.48 → 242.56]  whole damn expo dark goblin's getting tough okay I don't know what the fuck's going on let's go for
[242.56 → 248.08]  an evo dart he's gonna go for a tesla let's protect it with a hero knight and then let's go for an
[248.08 → 251.92]  ability just to give it more health and then let's go for a minor in the back to keep the chip
[251.92 → 256.08]  damage going and then he's gonna go for arches let's go for a goblin curse and see if we can get
[256.08 → 260.32]  some extra chip damage dark goblin kind of going crazy over there and that's gonna be another goblin
[260.32 → 264.64]  if that dies at the last second it does and dark goblin locks on as well and that's gonna be so much
[264.64 → 268.72]  damage he might try and go for a tesla again we can go for another goblin curse oh look at this
[268.72 → 273.52]  this is just perfect and we've taken down 2.9 expo cycle unranked so we're gonna have to hit him
[273.52 → 279.92]  with some bm of course with a homemade dick but yeah okay let's not choke all right I know what
[279.92 → 283.44]  the game's trying to do let's finish him off with goblin curse of course and yeah I've been
[283.44 → 287.92]  having so many revelations and stuff in the last few years but the one thing I guess I'll say for
[287.92 → 293.84]  now is time just ticks on man things just things just keep moving it's kind of weird being 25 I guess
[295.76 → 299.20]  actually is kind of weird feels like just yesterday Kenny when he was
[299.60 → 306.64]  in his room making the first clash videos just grinding on call with people and streaming
[307.76 → 316.32]  I must have been like well I would have been well I mean I started when I was like 16 I guess I don't
[316.32 → 322.56]  know now look at me now look at me still still clashing but clash real clashes they never give
[322.56 → 326.16]  up man and I've always thought of this channel as more of a commentary channel anyway it's just
[326.24 → 330.64]  recently I've been a bit of a version for this game I mean there's a lot been a lot of like
[330.64 → 335.28]  goofy features they've been adding that I've been trying to get my claws into so let's go for a minor
[335.28 → 346.56]  here I'm actually okay we're lagging fantastic I've also got an awkward cycle here so I'm gonna
[346.56 → 350.88]  have to go with this and then I'm gonna go for a zap and hopefully we can arrange the cannon before
[350.88 → 355.28]  it dies but we're not going to be able to so that was a lot of elixir that wasn't very good
[355.28 → 359.44]  we're not in a good position here we're gonna have to come back somehow we have to have literally
[359.44 → 364.16]  the defense of our life here and I think the only way is a goblin curse cop out please goblin curse
[364.16 → 369.84]  go crazy but recruits are so fucking annoying I'm not gonna lie I can't afford one three elixir
[369.84 → 376.00]  card here so I'm gonna take a ton of damage please here yes okay at least oh my god at least the
[376.00 → 380.40]  dark golden retargeted and the recruit went back but that right there's exactly why I hate recruits
[380.40 → 384.80]  let's go for a minor in the back and let's see if we can get like a sneaky little ability on the
[384.80 → 390.40]  cannon cart here so that's that's what I'm talking about like that gets me so much extra damage right
[390.40 → 395.20]  there and a hp boost like that's so clutch if he goes evolve royal recruits of the bridge I'm gonna
[395.20 → 404.00]  go evolve uh bullet in my brain please do not do it okay let's go like this um the cannon cart and
[404.08 → 413.92]  doctor dude will okay towers down oh he missed he missed it doesn't even matter but he missed
[414.72 → 419.84]  let's try and make the most of it oh he's saved by double let's go for this and then let's go for
[419.84 → 425.76]  a minor see if we can get something here and then okay let's go for a goblin curse and a zap
[426.32 → 430.64]  and see if we can do something with the hero night ability maybe please goblins go he has to go
[430.64 → 434.72]  for an ability oh my god we're getting so much damage okay he's not gonna go for an ability this
[434.72 → 438.80]  game's actually not over now I was I thought it was gonna be over he might go for a cannon cart in
[438.80 → 444.56]  the middle now so let's go for this let's go for this on the tower and he's playing defensively so
[444.56 → 448.48]  let's go for a goblin curse hopefully goes for goblin gang he's not going to but let's go for an
[448.48 → 453.04]  evo zap anyway just because it's gonna be more damage and we got 20 seconds left you know what
[453.04 → 457.28]  we're gonna do we're gonna have to cycle he missed the arrows again hopefully he doesn't expect that
[457.28 → 462.32]  I'm back to goblin curse because my cycle so quick okay he does so let's go for this and then let's
[462.32 → 466.88]  see if we can kill the dark goblin we're gonna take the tower it looks like the question what he has
[466.88 → 473.44]  goblin barrel okay let's go for a hero night to get the extra hp and things off my tower and then
[473.44 → 480.48]  let's see if we can defend okay we have to take oh come on come on come on let's go for a zap here
[480.56 → 488.40]  as long as we don't get three crowned no no no no no
[491.60 → 496.72]  and just like that my sash is ruined but today's gonna be a short video because it's my birthday
[496.72 → 501.52]  so I am gonna drink alcohol and it's kind I actually don't really know why I came to Scotland
[501.52 → 506.80]  this time of year it is dark at three o'clock it was literally sunshine and rainbows in Australia
[506.80 → 511.12]  it's what you do for the right people am I right or am I right
